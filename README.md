# VFX compositing wiki
@ author: Jakub Jezek, jezschaj@gmail.com

A research project aiming to map all knowledge regarding vfx compositing techniques.

## Why this projet has started
There is a lot of books on the market which is trying to teach basic tachiques usable for evryday life of vfx compositor. You could spend ours of looking the appropriate method for the problem you are trying to learn or hack during your work. Year spend in the industry and you still thing it would be better if someone could just simply write a keywords of the problem and magically like in Google you would get at least three options to select from to quickly get the hack and use it for every day life and this is what should matter most.

## Project's bio
As the previous has described, it should be simple vfx search engine. No distruction and acces to it could be provided by simple API for R&D guy simply connect it to inhouse intranet wiki or front end pipeline panel perhaps inside Nuke/Fusion/Maya/Blender and so on. There would be only *.md files in database with keyword classifications for easy acces of search engine. As the project would be Open Source and is very humbly dependent on users to share. Most of it will be GitHub clonable so anyone could share simply with others.
